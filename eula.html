All Fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and you shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties, excluding only United States (federal or state) taxes. (c) Refunds, Upgrading and Downgrading: Refunds are processed according to our fair refund policy.

You can cancel your User Account at any time by clicking on the settings link in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The settings screen provides a simple no-questions-asked cancellation link. If you cancel your User Account before the end of your current paid up month, your cancellation will take effect immediately, and you will not be charged again. Please note that we do not provide refunds for unused time in the last billing cycle. (e) Termination and Suspension by DataPort: DataPort may terminate your User Account and/or these Terms of Service at any time and for any reason upon notice to you. We may also suspend our Service to you at any time, with or without cause. If we terminate your User Account without cause, we will refund a prorated portion of your monthly prepayment. We will not refund or reimburse you if we terminate your User Account for cause, including (without limitation) for a violation of these Terms of Service. (f) Effect of Termination: Once your User Account is terminated, we may permanently delete your User Account and any or all User Content associated with it. If you do not log in to your User Account for 12 or more months, we may treat your User Account as “inactive” and permanently delete the User Account and all the data associated with it. Except where an exclusive remedy may be specified in this Agreement, the exercise by either party of any remedy, including termination, will be without prejudice to any other remedies it may have under these Terms of Service. All sections of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination will survive, including without limitation, accrued rights to payment, use restrictions and indemnity obligations, confidentiality obligations, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability.
