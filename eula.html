We will not refund or reimburse you if we terminate your User Account for cause, including (without limitation) for a violation of these Terms of Service. (f) Effect of Termination: Once your User Account is terminated, we may permanently delete your User Account and any or all User Content associated with it.

Except where an exclusive remedy may be specified in this Agreement, the exercise by either party of any remedy, including termination, will be without prejudice to any other remedies it may have under these Terms of Service.
